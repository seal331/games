# Games

A collection of small games. Configuration is done using the configure tool written in C++.

## How to compile

TLDR: type "make", configure the games, then "make install".

Full list of make targets:

1. configure - compiles and runs the configure tool
2. mines - compiles the minesweeper game
3. snake - compiles the snake game
4. clean - cleans up game configuration and binaries
5. install - installs the games, the default location is /usr/local
